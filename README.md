# ðŸš— Pontus Car Shop

Welcome to the Pontus Car Shop project! This guide will help you set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed, targeting `.NET 7.0`.
- **Docker**: The project uses Docker for services like PostgreSQL and SMTP4DEV. Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- **Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code**: The project contains a Visual Studio solution file (`shop.sln`) and a Visual Studio Code workspace file (`PontusShop.code-workspace`).

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Contains the main business logic, entities, and configurations. It uses packages like `AutoMapper`, `MediatR`, `EntityFrameworkCore`, and more.
- **Web**: This is the web layer of the application, containing the client app built with React. It uses packages like `@coreui/coreui`, `@coreui/react`, and more.
- **Infrastructure**: (Not detailed, but typically contains data access code and other infrastructure concerns).
- **Docker**: The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root sets up services like PostgreSQL and SMTP4DEV.
